Calendar Solution is a set of open source PHP classes and database scripts
that provide a simple way to post events on your website or intranet.

The existing output formats include a calendar view, detailed list,
summary table and bullet list. Any PHP programmer can quickly add
custom formats as well.

Calendar Solution can use MySQL (via PHP's mysql or mysqli extensions),
PostgreSQL or SQLite (via PHP's sqlite or sqlite3 extensions) as the
database system.

The current release branch is "3". Development happens on "master".

Please see include/CalendarSolution/doc/README.TXT for more information.
