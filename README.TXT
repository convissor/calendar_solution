Calendar Solution is a set of open source PHP classes and database scripts
that provide a simple way to post events on your website or intranet.

The existing output formats include a calendar view, detailed list,
summary table and bullet list. Any PHP programmer can quickly add
custom formats as well.

Calendar Solution can use MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite as the database system.

Please see include/CalendarSolution/doc/README.TXT for more information.
