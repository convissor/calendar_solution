Calendar Solution is a set of open source PHP classes and database scripts
that provide a simple way to post events on your website or intranet.

The existing output formats include a calendar view, detailed list,
summary table and bullet list. Any PHP programmer can quickly add
custom formats as well.

Calendar Solution can use MySQL (via PHP's mysql or mysqli extensions),
PostgreSQL or SQLite (via PHP's sqlite or sqlite3 extensions) as the
database system.

Directory Structure:
calendar/  = pages to be displayed by web servers
include/   = classes to perform the tasks requested by the pages

The stable release branch is "2.1".  Development happens on "master".
The code in master is significantly changed from 2.1 and will become
the next release.  That release will be made from a branch named "3"
(though that branch does not exist yet).

Please see include/CalendarSolution/doc/README.TXT for more information.
