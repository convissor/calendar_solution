# To generate a new user/password, cd into this directory then issue
# the following command:
#
# htpasswd .htpasswd put_name_you_want_here
#
# If you get a "command not found" error, or similar, you will need
# to use the full path to the executable.  On Unix/Linux/BSD systems,
# one can find the path via "locate htpasswd".  On Windows boxes,
# the program is in the "bin" sub-directory where Apache is
# installed.  For example:
#   "C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache\bin\htpasswd"
#
# See the .htaccess file for further installation instructions.
