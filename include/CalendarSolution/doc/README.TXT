* Installation instructions are in the INSTALL.TXT file in
this directory.

* Upgrading instructions are in the UPGRADE.TXT file in
this directory.

* Complete documentation about the inner workings of the PHP
code can be found by opening ./phpdoc-output/index.html
in a web browser.  That output is based on the documentation
block comments found in each PHP script.  The transformation
from comments to human-readable format was performed by
running the ./compile_phpdoc_html.sh script, which utilizes
phpDocumentor.

* Unit tests are available in the Tests directory.  To run all tests:
	cd Tests
	phpunit .
